# Logistic-Regression--Predictive-Modelling

This repository contains a logistic regression model implemented for binary (or multi-class) classification. Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to predict the probability of a categorical dependent variable. This README will guide you through the project setup, data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and insights.

**Project Overview**

Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification. This project applies logistic regression to predict class labels (such as "yes/no", "success/failure", or "spam/not spam") based on input features. The project demonstrates how to preprocess data, build a logistic regression model, evaluate its performance, and interpret the results.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project have the following characteristics:

* age: age
* workclass: workclass
* education: highest education
* marrital status: marital status
* occupation: occupation
* sex: sex
* capital gain: income from investment sources other than salary/wages
* capital loss: income from investment sources other than salary/wages
* working hours: nummber of working hours per week
* salary: salary


**Dependencies**

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn

**Data Preprocessing**

Data preprocessing is essential to improve the model's performance and accuracy. Steps include:

* Handling Missing Values: Filling or dropping missing values to ensure clean data.
* Encoding Categorical Variables: Converting categorical features into numerical format using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
* Feature Scaling: Normalizing or standardizing features to ensure they are on a similar scale (logistic regression performs better with standardized data).
* Train-Test Split: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

**Model Building**

Import Logistic Regression Model: The logistic regression model from scikit-learn is used in this project.

**Model Evaluation**

Model performance is evaluated using various metrics:

* Accuracy: Proportion of correct predictions
* Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Measures the quality of the model's classifications.
* ROC Curve and AUC Score: Evaluate model's performance across different classification thresholds.
* Confusion Matrix
* A table showing true positiInsights and Interpretation

**Insights and Interpretation**

* The logistic regression model provides insights into the importance of features in predicting the target variable. Interpreting the coefficients of logistic regression helps understand the direction and magnitude of relationships between features and the target variable. For example:
    -A positive coefficient indicates that an increase in that feature increases the likelihood of the positive class.
    -A negative coefficient suggests that an increase in that feature decreases the likelihood of the positive classves, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
